#### Worthwile
  - https://github.com/berkaroad/ddd (Domain Driven Design by golang), 2015/12, quite extensive and flexible

#### Really minimal / MVP
  - https://github.com/mcveat/event-sourcing-cqrs (Example of Event Sourcing and CQRS in golang), (2016/02) - just an example, not maintained
  - https://github.com/andrewwebber/cqrs (2015)
